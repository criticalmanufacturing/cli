It handles the low-level details of sending and receiving data.</li> <li>Custom Task: A custom task is a function or method that performs a specific action within the MES workflow. It has defined inputs and outputs and can be triggered by events or other tasks.</li> <li>Custom Converter: A custom converter transforms the output of a task into a different format or data type. This is often necessary to ensure compatibility with other systems or tasks.</li> <li>Automation Task Library (ATL): The recommended approach for MES v11 and later to create an IoT Task Library. ATLs separate UI metadata from the Node.js package. This metadata required to render tasks and converts on the MES UI, is now stored as a <code>json</code> file in the MES entity called <code>AutomationTaskLibrary</code>. This change has improved Workflow Designer experience and removed UI and IoT components inter-dependencies.</li> <li>Tasks Package Library (Deprecated): An older method for creating custom IoT logic, used in MES v7 through v10.
